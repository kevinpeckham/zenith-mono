							p.mt-0 We created an internal workforce H&amp;S indicator for Zenith Energy, the Incident Composite Rate (ICR), to better represent the factors that could attribute to workplace incidents. The ICR considers employee tenure with the company because an increased rate of error can be expected from employees within the first stages of employment and when there is a high turnover rate. The maximum score for the ICR is 100, representing work successfully performed every time, and our annual target is 90.

							p.mt-0 Some of the best safety improvement ideas come from employees. We encourage our employees with ideas, concerns, or suggestions for improved safety in the workplace to raise them and bring them to the attention of the Health, Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory Manager. Reports and concerns about workplace safety issues may be made anonymously if the employee wishes and all reports can be made without fear of reprisal.

							p.mt-0 As part of our comprehensive Health, Safety, Environmental, and Regulatory (HSER) framework we have implemented specific safety measures and procedures at all our facilities ranging from training of site management and staff to monitoring and inspections of facilities, and incident related protocols. Frontline supervisors must complete a verification to evaluate on-site personnel safety performance and utilize reporting channels in place for disclosure of unsafe conditions including an anonymous hotline. There are onsite safety personnel at our four largest terminals, rigorous on-site inspections at all our facilities, and routine incident response drills and training of our operations teams. In an effort to continuously improve, Zenith Energy conducts annual assessments and has digitized our plan management.
