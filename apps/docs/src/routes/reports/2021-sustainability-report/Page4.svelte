						.mb-4 The insurance company was eager to deploy and move quickly. SecureLogix was able to turn on and deliver full call branding services just 15 business days following contract signature for all 37,000 corporate phone numbers, 5,000 of which are corporate wireless devices. This included call branding coverage across all major service providers (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon) representing 95% of wireless customers.

						.mb-4 SecureLogix is uniquely positioned to deliver fast and unified call branding results with a single contracting handshake. SecureLogix provides clients with a single contracting relationship through its consolidated stack of resellers agreements and API technology integrations that simplifies call branding coverage across all major voice carriers and their associated data analytics vendors.

						.mb-4 Though they had not planned and budgeted for a purchase in 2022, project sponsors inside the voice infrastructure team advocated that call branding and spoofing protection services were	cost reduction initiatives backed by immediate hard-dollar payback and ROI. Ultimately the company purchased to cover all outbound calls across all lines-of-business to measure the full potential business impact of increased call answer rates.

						.mb-4 SecureLogix and its service provider channel partners quickly analyzed the insurance companyâ€™s outbound call volumes to develop a single contract proposal covering calls to 95% of wireless devices and providers. Rigorous pre-and-post-deployment data gathering and reporting was equally important to establish the high confidence answer rate baselines across all calling numbers needed to build true, hard-dollar ROI figures post deployment. This required fast and accurate coordination by SecureLogix to resolve and unify corporate calling number lists, answer rates, and other call data across the three major service providers and call analytics vendors.

						.mb-4 In addition to call branding, the insurance company purchased spoofing protection for calls to AT&amp;T wireless devices in late 2022 as a pilot prior to extending spoofing protection services to Verizon and T-Mobile devices in early 2023.
